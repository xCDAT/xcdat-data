# xcdat-data

This repository exists to hold example datasets for [xcdat](https://xcdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-guide/overview.html) (e.g., as used in the documentation)
that would bloat the [main repository](https://github.com/xCDAT/xcdat) if included there.

All datasets have been subsetted to "1870-01-01" and "1879-12-31".
